# Resume
At one point I was using Microsoft Word to manage my resume.
However to achieve the format I was looking for I needed a complicated and messy system of tables.
I kept thinking 'this would be so much easier with pug'

This application allows live editing of pug and SCSS which is rendered through an express server.
It works just enough to get the job done.
